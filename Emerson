My project is a Raspberry pi based motion activated security camera with a website.

upon activation it will upload "video" of a series of still pictures to a website. (every second? every two?)

I will look into full video streaming but due to the pi's limited proccessing power im worried it 
wont be able to stream hd videos.

if time allows I would like to add the ability to turn on the camera via the web client.

note, camera interface is already coded for the pi.
 half way point would be to get the camera detecting motion and taking pictures. 
 
CORE:
1. Install motion on pi
2. Mount shared windows folder
3. Modify motion.conf so that it is always running, 2 fps, saves in shared folder
HALF:
4. Make stream open to everyone //hello
5. Intergrate into a website
6. tune and make everything pretty
EXTRA:
7. Would be nice to get a email or text when it is set off 
8. see how fast a fps the pi can handle
9. auto delete once a week to keep the folder clear
10.option to turn off via shh or something 
11. always streaming at 1 pic per minute even when no motion.

==============JOURNAL======================
oct 30th:
    raspberry pi camera arrived today, spent the better part of an hour updating
	Raspbian to the most current version.  then I had to upgrade the drivers to 
	interface with the camera. took a few pictures using commands through ssh.
	
nov 2ed:
    camera housing came in today, took way to long to get everything in to it.
	its a little bit small but I made it fit.

nov 9th:
    I spent entirely to much time trying to get a windows shared folder to mount on my pi.
    turns out Hamachi makes it so that the pi cant find my computer through it ip address.
    after uninstalling Hamachi I managed to get the folder to mount, but upon reboot it 
	couldn’t find it again, so ive decided to use a flash drive to hold the pictures, 32 gig ordered and on the way.

nov 13th: 
    flash drive arrived and mounted to the pi. now that the drive is attached the pi no longer fits into its housing, 
	so I have it taped to a zippo. much less cool.

nov 16th: 
    started reading up about motion and how it works, learned it has a built in streamer so that’s cool.
	also learned it doesn’t support the new raspberry pi camera... yeah the one I just bought.  after searching around for a while 
	there is a guy who has a work around he calls motion_MMAL so im going to figure out how to install that with motion.

nov 30th:
    forgot to log the 23ed but I got motion installed and I got MMAL downloaded, I have learned to many Linux commands lately.
	today I finished messing with the motion_MMAL package, once that was installed I started messing with the motion.conf file.
	I currently have it set for 2 fps 1280X720. its taking pictures and saving them on the flash drive, the stream is working
	but only when im on the same network(in my house/on my wifi). 

dec 2ed:
    disaster has struck! my raspberry pi decided a good place to store pictures would be over the operating systems... 
	how is that even possible. the pi is now a brick and the sd card is completely useless, upon putting it into my computer 
	is registers as BOOT: and is only 54mb in size, when I formatted it it remained 54mb(its supposed to be 4 gigs).
	I don’t know what to do about this and all the files on the flash drive are corrupt so I don’t even have any pictures of when it was working.
	got to love technology...
	
dec	3ed:
    I fixed my SD card this morining in a stroke of genius, I formatted the card in my d7000 then I put it in my laptop and put it back to 
	fs24 or whatever, I have the operating system loading onto it now.

dec 5th:(am)
    I have the camera connected and taking pictures, motion is installed and modified to work with MMAL. Unfortunately   the flash drive will 
	no longer stay mounted. Everything is the same except the power supply, which is just a different phone charger then the one I had
    (I may have lost the old one).
	
dec 5th:(pm)
    turns out the phone charger that im using now is 1 amp and the old one was a 3 a that I bought beacuse it had enough power to run the pi
    and external drives. so due to me losing that one I can’t mount a flash drive without it cutting out every time the cpu needs more power.
    im going to look for the old one, but so far I haven’t had any luck.
	
dec 7th:
    I cant find my old charger and I dont have time or money to buy a powered hub.  with this being the beginning of final week I think im just 
	going to tap out on this on, I had it working( well other then streaming out side of my network). with more time and a few more parts im sure
	I could have gotten it back into working order.  over all I have learned a massive amount about how linux works, things like boot order,
	how external drives are classified and mounted, networking stuff manily pertaining to ip and network names, and a whole heap of commands for 
	installing moving and opening files.
